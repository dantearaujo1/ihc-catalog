Face detection is performed using the Viola-Jones face detection algorithm. Landmark detection is then applied to each facil bounding box and 34 landmarks identified. If the confidence of the landmark detection is below a threshold then the bounding box is ignored. The facial landmarks, head pose and intraocular distance for each face are exposed in the SDK.  Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) are extracted from the image region of interest defined by the facial landmark points. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers, trained on 10,000s of manually coded facial images collected from around the world, are used to provide scores from 0 to 100 for  each facial action. The emotion expressions (Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise and Contempt) are based on combinations of facial actions. This coding was built on the EMFACS emotional facial action coding system. The emotion expressions are given a similar score from 0 (absent) to 100 (present). In addition to facial action and emotion expression classifiers the SDK has classifiers for determining gender and whether the person is wearing glasses. The classifiers have two operating modes: static and causal. The static classifiers allow classification of single images. The causal classifiers leverage temporal information available in video sequences to further increase the accuracy of the facial expression measures."

A simple algorithm was developed to parse the creation dates of photos taken by the SenseCam, and search the time stamps of the corresponding vector of the GSR readings from the SenseWear. For identifying the peaks of emotional arousal, another algorithm finds sequences of consecutive GSR readings where each value is higher than its predecessor, and creates a peak object consisting of start and end times of the peak, its height, differences between readings and score. The latter is computed by dividing the overall relative height of the peak by the number of readings in the sequence. The interface consists of two views for choosing recorded sessions and photo viewing that allows for browsing all photos within the data file.  Users could cycle through them and make annotations on the current photo."

            "main_ideia": "FaceReader is able to describe facial expressions and other facial features online with a remarkable accuracy. alternative to traditional keyboard and mouse commands. The human ability to read emotions from someone’s facial expressions is the basis of facial affect processing that can lead to expanding interfaces with emotional communication and, in turn, to obtaining a more flexible, adaptable, and natural interaction between humans and machines. There is a network to classify the emotional expression shown on a face in one of the categories: happy, angry, sad, surprised, scared, disgust or neutral. These emotional categories are also known as the “basic emotions” or “universal emotions”",
            "general_procedure": "The core problem of face analysis is how to simultaneously account for the three major source of variance in face images: pose/orientation, expression and lighting. To counter the problems caused by these sources of variation, the FaceReader classifies a face in three consecutive steps: 1. Face finding: an accurate position of a face is found using a method called the Active Template Method. The Active Template Method displaces a deformable face template over an image, returning the most likely face position or multiple positions if we allow more than one face to be analyzed; 2. Face modeling: Next, we use a model-based method called the Active Appearance Model (AAM) to synthesize an artificial face model, which describes both the locations of key points, as well as the texture of the face in a very low dimensionality. The AAM uses a set of annotated images to calculate the main sources of variation found in face images and uses PCA compression to reduce the model dimensionality. New face models can then be described as deviations from the mean face, using a compact vector called the “appearance vector”; 3: Face classification: The final stage in the FaceReader architecture is the actual classification of the expression or facial features we are interested in. This can be done in a very straightforward way by training an artificial neural network, which takes the AAM appearance vector as input. Given enough training data, we can train the network to learn to classify any facial feature as long as this feature is well modeled in the synthesized faces."

FACS also includes a system to describe the intensity of each AU by affixing a letter A through E after the numeric code but before the plus sign.

If it is identified that any item does not apply to the scope of the assessment, the observer must previously mark the tool \"do not apply (N / A)\" in order to avoid distractions during observation. It is recommended that the observer study the tool and gain familiarity with the check items. Conducting the pilot assessment can help the evaluators' familiarity with checklist checkpoints. It is recommended to start filling the tool with the items in the human-thing category that are related to the user's direct contact with the \"things\" in order to fulfill the set of tasks established in the evaluation. The subcategory \"general aspects of UX\" can be evaluated for the whole set of tasks of the experiment. However, the subcategories of \"context sensitivity\" and \"programmability\" can be observed in tasks that allow their observation in both categories. Thus, it is recommended that the evaluators prepare the evaluation environment so that it can reproduce contextual situations that are key to the operation of the IoT application, whether performed in the laboratory or in the actual context of use. After completing the items in the first category, items of the thing-thing. It is suggested to indicate in the evaluation planning the marking of the tasks directly related to the verification of these items. The reproduction of contextual situations will be paramount for the observation of these items. It is important to reinforce that the items in this category relate to the operation of the IoT environment and are not directly related to the user's actions."

The extracted information is then used by  the  AL  upon  the  UX  expert  request  to  enable  different  types  of  analytics  to  infer  the  informed decision.  The  final  layer  is  the  visualization  server,  which  serves  as  a  toolkit  for  the  UX  expert  to evaluate the digital product. "

Each of subsequent stimuli can be rated in two to three minutes. An additional and very important feature of the abbreviated scales is that the adjective pairs used are easy to understand. This makes the scales suitable for large-scale commercial and survey applications where respondents have a limited vocabulary (e.g., testing the emotional impact of a feature length film, television advertisement, shop or shopping mall, musical recording, political advertisement, personal image projected by a political candidate). These scales include:  A 4-item State Pleasure-Displeasure Scale A 4-item State Arousal-Nonarousal Scale A 4-item State Dominance-Submissiveness Scale Items of these three scales are intermixed within a 12-item inventory to minimize subject awareness of the scale dimensions, thereby enhancing validity.

Instead of relying on the use of words, respondents can report their emotions with the use of expressive cartoon animations.

            "general_procedure": "The procedure of a PrEmo experiment is self-running. The computer screen displays instructions that guide respondents through the procedure, which includes an explanation of the experiment and an exercise. The program’s heart is the measurement interface, which was designed to be simple and intuitive in use. The top section of this interface depicts stills of the 14 animations. Each still is accompanied by a (hidden) three-point scale. These scales represent the following ratings: “I do feel the emotion,” “to some extent I feel the emotion,” and “I do not feel the emotion expressed by this animation.” The rating scales are ‘hidden behind’ the animation frames. A scale appears on the side of the animation frame only after the animation is activated by clicking on the particular still. The lower section of the interface displays a picture of the stimulus and an operation button. During an experiment, the respondents are first shown a (picture of a) product and subsequently instructed to use the animations to report their emotion(s) evoked by the product. While they view an animation, they must ask themselves the following question: “does this animation express what I feel?” Subsequently, they use the three-point scale to answer this question. Visual feedback of the scorings is provided by the background colour of the animation frame."

The software will proceed with processing the choice. The choices of the affective states obey the following order: firstly, the doll for the Satisfaction is chosen; then the doll for Motivation and then the Doll on Control. At any time, the person can restart his choice by bringing the \"Restart\" management doll closer to the reader. At the end of the choice of each dimension, the person can \"Confirm\" or \"Do Not Confirm\" the choices, bringing the corresponding bicorder puppet closer to the reader. Then the system is automatically prepared for a new choice of affective states by another participant."

Furthermore, the evaluator can view a user session live and provide annotations for it, or review the recorded data and further process them after the experiment. The tool provides two views for an experiment:  (i) a view of each interaction session, named Timeline, and (ii) insights from the entire experiment, based on all the users that are involved in it throughout the experiment period."

WAMMI's uniqueness lies in that visitor satisfaction for the site being evaluated is compared with values from our reference databases, which now contain data from over 320 surveys. I benchmark websites, portal or intranet against others to see if it scored a good or bad result. By tracking performance over time, it sees if the improvements made have given the desired results from visitors pespective.  By asking additional questions, important information about visitors profiles, purpose of visit and how the website can be improved is obtained and cross referenced with the WAMMI results. WAMMI is a scientific analytics service, iteratively developed using Psychometric techniques. ",

The WAMMI team will assist the selecting additional questions to suit the business needs. When there are sufficient responses, usually after about two weeks, the evaluation is terminated. Owner receive an electronic report within two working days. The report benchmarks how well your site performs. Visitor reactions to the site are compared with values in our reference database and are shown in the WAMMI profile results and the Global Usability Score (GUS). More detailed analysis can be made by statement analysis and from visitor feedback about the changes and improvements made. The questionnaire can be used to evaluate intranet, using testing and educational purposes."
